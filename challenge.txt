Begin by finding the minimum and maximum value in the rating_count_tot column.

Extract the values in the rating_count_tot column (index number 5) in a separate list (don't forget to convert to integer or float).
Find out the minimum and maximum value of that list using the min() and the max() commands.
Based on the minimum and maximum value you've found, choose a few intervals (try to choose five intervals or less).

We've disabled answer checking for this exercise to give you the freedom to choose the intervals you find suitable (there's not a fixed solution for this exercise). You can see the intervals we chose in the solution.
Once you've chosen the intervals, compute the frequency of apps for each interval. Store the frequency table in a dictionary.

Create a dictionary with intervals as dictionary keys and zeros as dictionary values.
Loop through the apps_data data set. Count the frequency of each interval using an if statement followed by a series of elif clauses.
Inspect the frequency table and analyze the results.
